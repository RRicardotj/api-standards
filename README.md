# API PROJECTS BASE

This project serve like a base for others apis. Since a while ago I have been making changes in the api trying to develop a good pattern for a api rest in nodejs.
In this repository there are severals branch with small changes.
The branch I recomend to use is master-pro because it is the best API model I ever made.
Currently I'm working in other changes to adapt the API with MongoDB. The branch name for that changes will call master-mongodb
